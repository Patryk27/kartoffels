        │ stabs the bot that's directly in front of you, killing it    │
        │ and giving you one point - note that you have to be facing   │
        │ the other bot in order to stab it                            │
        │                                                              │
        │ easy enough, isn't it?                                       │
        │                                                              │
        │ now, to complete the tutorial, implement a bot that performs │
        │ a 3x3 scan, rotates towards the closest enemy ('@'), drives  │
        │ forward and stabs it; when no enemy is in sight, let your    │
        │ bot continue moving in its current direction                 │
        │                                                              │
        │ for simplicity, the enemies will not try to kill you and     │
        │ they will be located directly north / east / west / south -  │
        │ i.e. you don't have to worry about diagonals                 │
        │                                                              │
